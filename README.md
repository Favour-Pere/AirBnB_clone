The Airbnb clone project for which we are creating a copy of the  [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/). Only some features will be implemented and will be listed below once completed.

## Description Command Interpreter

The Command Interpreter is used to manage the whole application's functionality from the command line, such as:

-   Crete a new object.
-   Retrieve an object from a file, database, etc.
-   Execute operation on objects. e.g. Count, compute statistics, etc.
-   Update object's attributes.
-   Destroy an object.

## In details

Project Description This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project where we worked on the backend of the project whiles interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in python.

Data (python objects) generated are stored in a json file and can be accessed with the help of the json module in python

Description of the command interpreter: The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some of the commands available are:

show create update destroy count And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the folowing actions can be performed:

Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place) Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc… Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…) Updating attributes of an object Destroying an object

## Usage

To launch the console application in interactive mode simply run:
